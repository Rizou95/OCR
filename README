To run our program you first need to compile it with: make all.
Then once it all compiled you will have an executable named OCR.

To run it do ./OCR 'path of the image' 'blur_level' 'angle of rotation' 'path of the file to solve' 'number of the function'

    - path of the image is self explanatory.
    - blur_level is the level of blur applied by the gaussian blur.
    - angle of rotation is self explanatory.
    - path of the file to solve is the file with the sudoku in text.
    - number of the function chose which fonction to run: 1 - solver; 2 - preprocessing; 3 - rotation; 4 - detection; 5 - network XOR

At the end you can do a make clean.
